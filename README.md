# Ernani Digital CV

I like digital things. I also like the idea of paper-like things on internet. So I created this digital CV to show the same information I have on my CV but in the internet.

But I failed with the paper part of it, I really like colors in everything I build and this one couldn't be different.

# Tech things

I will do some testing to make sure everything is running okay at the pipeline.

## Some tech debt I will solve later

- Content on `content.ts` file.
- Better organizing my components and sections
