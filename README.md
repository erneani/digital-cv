# Ernani Digital CV

I don't really like digital things anymore, but the idea of a nice digital CV didn't gone away from my mind.

That said, I will improve the current CV applying some really important information on it. Nothing confidential, though.

I am feeling I will fail the paper-like part of it by applying some colors, but I don't really think people will often get worried about it.

# Tech things

There are no tech things. It's just HTML, CSS and content, as everything should.
